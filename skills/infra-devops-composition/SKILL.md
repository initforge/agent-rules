# infra-devops-composition

**Status:** materialized (skill-mcp-fabric-v1, AM-0002 full adoption)
**Activation class:** ROUTED (deterministic RepoFacts/TaskFacts; never keyword-only)

## Use when
- Deterministic repo/task facts for this domain are observed (see trigger facts).
- The claim/task actually requires this capability; smallest sufficient proof.

## Do NOT
- Do not activate from generic keywords (frontend/database/design/test/UI).
- Do not decide scope, completion, PASS or acceptance; kernel owns those.
- Do not bypass or skip verifiers; missing providers are BLOCKED/NEEDS_USER.

## Trigger facts (deterministic)
- terraform; kubernetes; docker compose; ci provider; infra plan.

## Capabilities
- filesystem.read, shell.exec, owner.approval

## Provider mapping
- Providers resolved by the CapabilityBroker (registry.json / integrations);
  unavailable providers yield UNAVAILABLE/BLOCKED, never fabricated PASS.

## Rollback
- Remove this skill directory and its catalog/fabric entries; restore the
  previous route receipts.

## Eval status
- Route precision: high; WITH/WITHOUT ablation corpus: pending (TASK-012).
